## Goal of this Example Project

This example project is meant to serve as a more complex example of the concepts learned in the LHTP.com lesson [Event Handler Properties in a Project: Using `window.onload`](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/javascript-and-web-browsers/event-handler-properties-in-a-project-using-window-onload).

This repo contains code for a webpage that showcases the differences between prime and composite numbers, using buttons that change the background of numbers in a grid. Here's what the website looks like:

![This gif shows the prime/composite numbers website and the effects of clicking on the two buttons that change the background color of the number grid.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oafrwi3rq8j8znw/prime-composit-numbers.gif?raw=1)

Note that this repo uses CSS Grid, which is not covered in LHTP.com. If you are interested in learning about it, here are two resources to get you started:
